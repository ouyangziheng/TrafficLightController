# Configurable Traffic Light Controller

## Introduction

This project is my final assignment for the **second-year Verilog course at Nankai University**. It implements a configurable traffic light controller module based on Verilog. The design meets the requirement for synchronized switching between traffic lights and introduces an additional manual control feature.
